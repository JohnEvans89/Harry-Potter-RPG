// Beauxbatons has a unique sorting method. 
// In order to be sorted, you must shoot a silver arrow across the room. 
// After several seconds, the arrow will burst into sparks of your house color: 
// Purple for Papillionlisse, 
// Blue for OmbreLune and 
// green for Bellefeuille. The arrow will choose a house based on your personality, character, 
// and demeanor. Certain traits exemplify certain houses. You may possess 
// all the traits or strongly possess only one of them. The house descriptions are outlines 
// for your character, but not definite facts.
