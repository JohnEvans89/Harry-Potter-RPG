--if the 2 types are valid, make the conversion and update int account.  

 

Check how the character/player are set up with attributes. Add a getter and setter for wallet. Figure out how often are students spending money. Is it just a niche thing at the start of term or will they need it thruout. I want to say the MacUSA is more modern than Hogwarts and would have wizarding banks with credit cards and modern tech...like pens.(research illvermorny-I might just make it like normal life, but more wizardy) 

Maybe anythingToContibure is acting up becayse it’s void. 

 

Start schools as an array of options. If brazil or africa, only leave the respective schools 

Then check blood. If not pure, take durmstrang ff the list 

ArayList String schools = new Array.asList(“H” , ”I” , “B” , “D” , “Af” , “Br”); 

what are the remove methods for an array? Can you pick by name? Maybe a list. 

 

List myList = new ArrayList(); or with generics ( Java 7 or later) List<MyType> myList = new ArrayList<>(); or with generics (Old java versions)... 

List<String> messages = Arrays.asList("Hello", "Wo... 

new ArrayList<String>(); 2. Arrays.asList("A", "B", "C") 

 

I want blood status and location to effect the schools that will accept you. Durstrang will accept anyone with pure blood. Hogwarts will take anyone from the UK 

For the sake of this converter, 
1 Galleon = 5 Pounds,



Dr=1.5*D 
D=dr/1.5
For the sake of this converter, 
1 Dragot = 1.5 US Dollar. 
 
There are 17 Sickles in a Galleon, 
and 29 Knuts in a Sickle,
 
 2 United States Dollars = 5 Sickles and 6 Knuts
 1 United States Dollar = 2 Sickles and 18 Knuts

1 Knut = 0.02 United States Dollars 
1 Sickle = 0.38
1 Galleon = 6.41 United States Dollars

o=n/641

I don’t think Illvermorny or bautaton have limitations. I guess in theory you could go to eaither if from england.  

Should the first check be blood or location? 

Write both 

public void schoolOptions(){ 

If(BR){ 

Schools=BR 

} 

Else If(AFR){ 

Return africa 

} 

How to phrase the blood status condition 

Else if ( 

 

int input; 

int newMoney; 

public int moneyChange(){ 

Scanner scan = new Scanner (System.in); 

sysout("What is your muggles currency?"); //this may not be necessary after the country code//US=$ UK=pound or euro, etc. 

input=scan.nextInt; 

//dummy conversion 

newMoney=(input*2)/2; 

return newMoney; 

} 

 

Default money to 0 at the start like HP/maxHP and XP 

Player.wallet=newMoney;
